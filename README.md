- Optional: [nodemon](http://nodemon.io/)

## Installation

- Download the [repo](https://github.com/DIAndrei/node-file-upload/archive/master.zip)
- Install node modules: `npm install`
- Start the server: `node server.js` or, if you have nodemon installed: `npm run dev`


## Usage: 

- Create a folder named 'uploads' in the root folder `node-file-upload-master`
